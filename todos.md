# Todos
- tidy errors of yamf and signature
- test coverage.
- verify entry
  - lipmma links to correct seq
  - previous links to correct seq
  - payload length is correct
  - signing verifies ok
  - the author is the correct author for that feed (same author as the previous entry)
  - we have a complete chain of lipmaa links that get back to the first entry.
  - is not after an end of feed message.
- cli tool?
  - if we use an offset file for a log, partial replication will not work. offset files expect sequential data. Or there would need to be a mapping from flume_seq to actual seq? 
  - sqlite file?
  - functions
      - publish
      - add
      - verify
- [ ] test vectors
  - 
- sql table
  - author_id
  - message_id
  - seq_num
  - is_end_of_feed 
  - payload_id
  - payload_size
  - signature 
- sizing yamf types / find some way to be able to use arrays on the stack rather than
allocating. One way would be to 
  - have yamf and signature provide constants for encoded size. This would be kinda gross as
  the yamfs get more vairants.
  - have encode_write return number of bytes written and
- replication
